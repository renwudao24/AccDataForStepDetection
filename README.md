# AccDataForStepDetection

English description of acceleration data for pedestrian walking with flat holding smartphone.

1. Acceleration data were collected by two experiment personnel who walked 211 meters with flat holding smartphone. The experiment personnel were a male and a female. The male one is about 1.77 meters, the female one is about 1.58 meters. The smartphone type is Xiaomi 6. And the experimental testbed and trace are shown by the picture 'The true trace of experiment.tif'. The whole collection process is continous without any stop when turning the corner. 

2. There are two pieces of acceleration data. The Excel file marked by 1 is collected by the male personnel, the other one is by the female personnel. The true step numbers are 284 and 319, respectively.

3. Every Excel file has 4 columns. The first column is about X-axis acceleration(ax), the second one is about Y-axis acceleration(ay), the third one is about Z-axis acceleration(az). And the fourth column is about the magnitude of three-axis acceleration. The computational expression is sqrt(axax+ayay+az*az).
